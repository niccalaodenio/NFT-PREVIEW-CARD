## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
      In this challenge i learn how to use grid as a container element, and I understand the importance of using multiple container for even just a single element. 

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
### Continued development
    css combinators are quite useful I think it could be better if I keep on using those then the pseudo elements. the different uses of flexbox and grid


### Useful resources
    useful resources are github, google, mdn, w3school and stackoverflow haha
